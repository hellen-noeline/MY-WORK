Python is dynamically typed means that you dont need to declare the data type of a variable when you create it
y = 3
k = 6
sum = y+k

in python you can delete a variable using del_my_variable, yes i would delete an unnecessary variable to clean up my work


follow naming conventions
avoid overly long variable names
re-assign variables separately
